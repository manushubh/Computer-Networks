NS3
First program:- 
changes are all within the same file. (traffic-control)
One line from second.cc present under examples/tutorials.

Second program:- 
do the first program entirely. 
Refer examples/wireless/power-adaption-interface.cc 
copy the for loop and make necessary changes.

Third program:- 
refer third.cc in examples/tutorials. 
Add flow-monitor-module header
Copy same for loop as second from examples/wireless/power-adaption-interface.cc
Copy UDP flow from traffic-control.cc
In UDP flow, sinkapp->csmaNodes.get(nCsma)
apps.Add -> wifiStaNodes.Get(nWifi-1)
remoteAddress -> csmaInterfaces.GetAddress(nCsma)

Fourth program:- 
first go to examples/wireless/wifi-simple-adhoc.cc and add 3 header files which are on lines 61-63 in completed code.
Take mobility functions from third.cc
Copy flow again from traffic-control.cc
Copy same for loop from power-adaption upto throughput line.

Fifth program:-
use file src/csma/examples/csma-ping
add Time interPacket...... Line from wifi-simple-adhoc.cc
Change number of nodes to 6.
Add onoff functions from traffic-control.cc which is at lines 92-95 in completed code.
Again add for loop at the end like in question 4.
